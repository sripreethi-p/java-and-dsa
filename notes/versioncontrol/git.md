# Git

## What is git?
- Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) used to track changes in source code during software development. 
- It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by providing tools to manage different versions of code, merge changes from different branches, and roll back to previous versions if needed.
- Git is commonly used with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket to host repositories and facilitate collaboration on open-source and private projects.
- Key features of Git include:
  - **Distributed:** Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its history. 
  - **Version Control:** Git tracks changes made to files, allowing you to revert to previous versions or compare changes over time. 
  - **Branching and Merging:** You can create branches to develop features independently and then merge them back into the main codebase. 
  - **Collaboration:** Git makes it easy for multiple developers to work on the same project by providing mechanisms to handle conflicts, synchronize changes, and review code.
