# Greedy Algorithm

## Definition
A greedy algorithm is an optimization technique that makes choices for local optimizations to achieve a global optimization.
It operates on the principle of “taking the best option now” without considering the long-term consequences.  


## Examples
1. **Fractional Knapsack:** Optimizes the value of items that can be fractionally included in a knapsack with limited capacity.
2. **Dijkstra’s algorithm:** Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
3. **Kruskal’s algorithm:** Finds the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph.
4. **Huffman coding:** Compresses data by assigning shorter codes to more frequent symbols.
