# Structural Design Patterns

[definition, purpose, use cases, design, example, implementation]

- **Structural design patterns** are design patterns 
that focus 
on how classes and objects are composed 
to form larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. 
- They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire structure does not need to change as a result.


1. [Adapter](#1-adapter-pattern) - converts one interface to another, allowing incompatible interfaces to work together
2. [Bridge](#2-bridge-pattern) - decouples an abstraction from its implementation, enabling them to vary independently
3. [Composite](#3-composite-pattern) - composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
4. [Decorator](#4-decorator-pattern) - adds responsibilities to an object dynamically without altering its structure
5. [Facade](#5-facade-pattern) - provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes
6. [Flyweight](#6-flyweight-pattern) - reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of objects, making large numbers of fine-grained objects more efficient
7. [Proxy](#7-proxy-pattern) - controls access to another object, providing additional functionality like lazy initialization or security



## 1. Adapter Pattern

### Definition

- A pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. 
- It's often used when a class you need to use has the right functionality but the wrong interface.
- The adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects, translating requests or data between them, so they can communicate.

### Purpose
This is helpful when you have a legacy system or an external library that doesn't match your application's interfaces.

### Use cases

#### 1. Testing and Mocking
- **Scenario:** When writing unit tests, you may want to mock an external service or component that has a complex interface.
- **Solution:** An adapter can simplify the interface of the external service, making it easier to create mock implementations for testing purposes.

#### 2. Communication Protocols
- **Scenario:** You need to support multiple communication protocols (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket, FTP) in a system.
- **Solution:** You can create adapters for each protocol, enabling your system to handle different protocols via a unified interface.

#### 3. Third-Party Library Integration
- **Scenario:** A third-party library offers powerful functionality, but its API is different from what your application expects.
- **Solution:** An adapter can be used to convert the third-party library's interface into one that your application can easily interact with, maintaining loose coupling between your code and the library.



### Design

- `Adaptee` interface: The existing interface that needs adapting.
- `Target` interface: Defines the domain-specific interface that the client uses.
- `Adapter` class: The class that implements the target interface and translates the requests from the target to the adaptee.

### Example

Imagine you have an application that works with `AudioPlayer`, but now you need to integrate a `VideoPlayer`. 
Instead of modifying the existing `AudioPlayer` class, 
you can create an adapter for `VideoPlayer` to work with `AudioPlayer` without altering the original structure.

### Implementation

1. Define the `Target` interface (the new interface your client expects)

```java
interface AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    void play(String audioType, String fileName);
}
```
2. Create the `Adaptee` (The class that needs to be adapted)

```java
class LegacyMediaPlayer {
    void playMp4(String fileName) {
        System.out.println("Playing mp4 file: " + fileName);
    }

    void playVlc(String fileName) {
        System.out.println("Playing vlc file: " + fileName);
    }
}
```

3. Create the `Adapter` Class - The adapter class implements the `AdvancedMediaPlayer` interface and uses the `LegacyMediaPlayer` to provide the functionality.

```java
class MediaAdapter implements AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    LegacyMediaPlayer legacyMediaPlayer;

    public MediaAdapter(String audioType) {
        if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("vlc")) {
            legacyMediaPlayer = new LegacyMediaPlayer();
        } else if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp4")) {
            legacyMediaPlayer = new LegacyMediaPlayer();
        }
    }

    @Override
    void play(String audioType, String fileName) {
        if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("vlc")) {
            legacyMediaPlayer.playVlc(fileName);
        } else if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp4")) {
            legacyMediaPlayer.playMp4(fileName);
        }
    }
}    
```

4. `Client` code that uses the `Adapter`

```java
public class AudioPlayer implements  AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    MediaAdapter mediaAdapter;
    
    @Override
    void play (String fileType, String fileName) {
        // Playing mp3 directly
        if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp3")) {
            System.out.println("Playing mp3 file: " + fileName);
        }
        // Use adapter to play other file formats
        else if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("vlc") || audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp4")) {
            mediaAdapter = new MediaAdapter(audioType);
            mediaAdapter.play(audioType, fileName);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid media type: " + audioType + " format not supported");
        }
    }
}
```

5. Testing the Adapter Pattern

```java
public static void main (String[] args) {
    AudioPlayer audioPlayer = new AudioPlayer();
    
    audioPlayer.play("mp3", "song.mp3");   // Playing mp3 file: song.mp3
    audioPlayer.play("mp4", "video.mp4");  // Playing mp4 file: video.mp4
    audioPlayer.play("vlc", "movie.vlc");  // Playing vlc file: movie.vlc
    audioPlayer.play("avi", "film.avi");   // Invalid media type: avi format not supported
}
```

## 2. Bridge Pattern

### Definition

A design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation, 
allowing the two to vary independently.

### Purpose

This is useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.

### Use cases

#### 1. UI Frameworks
- In graphical user interface (GUI) frameworks, the abstraction (e.g., buttons, sliders) can be separated from their implementations (e.g., different operating systems or platforms). 
- This allows the same UI elements to work across multiple platforms without duplicating code.

#### 2. Database Access Layers
- When working with multiple database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), 
the Bridge pattern allows you 
to define a generic data access interface while implementing the specific details for each database system separately.

#### 3. Payment Processing Systems
- In e-commerce applications, different payment methods (credit cards, PayPal, cryptocurrencies) can be handled through a common interface, 
where the implementation can vary based on the payment provider.

### Design

* `Abstraction`: The high-level interface that defines the abstraction.
* `Implementor`: The interface that defines the implementation part.
* `RefinedAbstraction`: A concrete implementation of the abstraction.
* `ConcreteImplementor`: A concrete implementation of the implementor interface.

### Example
Let's consider a simple example involving shapes and colors.
Shapes don't know how to color themselves.

### Implementation

1. Define the `Implementor` Interface

```java
interface Color {
    void applyColor();
}
```

2. Create `Concrete Implementors`

```java
class RedColor implements Color {
    @Override
    public void applyColor() {
        System.out.println("Applying red color.");
    }
}
```

```java
class GreenColor implements Color {
    @Override
    public void applyColor() {
        System.out.println("Applying green color.");
    }
}
```

3. Define the Abstraction

```java
abstract class Shape {
    protected Color color;

    protected Shape(Color color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    abstract void draw();
}
```

4. Create `Refined Abstractions`

```java
class Circle extends Shape {
    public Circle(Color color) {
        super(color);
    }

    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.print("Drawing Circle. ");
        color.applyColor();
    }
}
```

```java
class Square extends Shape {
    public Square(Color color) {
        super(color);
    }

    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.print("Drawing Square. ");
        color.applyColor();
    }
}
```

5. `Client` code to demonstrate the usage

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape redCircle = new Circle(new RedColor());
        Shape greenSquare = new Square(new GreenColor());

        redCircle.draw(); // Output: Drawing Circle. Applying red color.
        greenSquare.draw(); // Output: Drawing Square. Applying green color.
}
```

<br></br>


## 3. Composite Pattern

### Definition

- A design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
- This pattern enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

#### Benefits
- **Uniformity:** Clients can treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Flexibility:** Itâ€™s easy to add new components (files or directories) without changing existing code.
- **Simplified Client Code:** Clients can work with complex tree structures more easily.

### Purpose

When you want to create a tree structured to composition of classes, 
while treating the individual objects and the composition uniformly.

### Use cases

### Design

- **Component:** An interface or abstract class for all objects in the composition.
- **Leaf:** Represents leaf nodes in the composition, which do not have any children.
- **Composite:** Represents a group of Leaf nodes and can have children.


### Example

Let's create a file system example where directories can contain files and other directories.

### Implementation

1. Define the `Component Interface`

```java
interface FileSystemComponent {
    void showDetails();
}
```

2. Create `Leaf Class`

```java
class File implements FileSystemComponent {
    private String name;

    public File(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("File: " + name);
    }
}
```

3. Create `Composite Class`

```java
class Directory implements FileSystemComponent {
    private String name;
    private List<FileSystemComponent> components = new ArrayList<>();

    public Directory(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void addComponent(FileSystemComponent component) {
        components.add(component);
    }

    public void removeComponent(FileSystemComponent component) {
        components.remove(component);
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Directory: " + name);
        for (FileSystemComponent component : components) {
            component.showDetails();
        }
    }
}
```

4. `Client` code to demonstrate the usage

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileSystemComponent file1 = new File("File1.txt");
        FileSystemComponent file2 = new File("File2.txt");
        
        Directory directory1 = new Directory("Directory1");
        directory1.addComponent(file1);
        directory1.addComponent(file2);
        
        FileSystemComponent file3 = new File("File3.txt");
        
        Directory directory2 = new Directory("Directory2");
        directory2.addComponent(directory1);
        directory2.addComponent(file3);

        // Display the file system structure
        directory2.showDetails();
        
        // Output-------
        /*
                Directory: Directory2
                    Directory: Directory1
                    File: File1.txt
                    File: File2.txt
                    File: File3.txt
         */
    }
```

<br></br>


## 4. Decorator Pattern


### Definition

### Purpose

### Use cases

### Design

### Example

### Implementation



<br></br>
**Purpose:** Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects by wrapping them in additional functionality without altering the object itself. It provides an alternative to subclassing for extending behavior.

**Application:** Adding additional features (e.g., scrollbars or borders) to GUI components.

**Example**: Say you want to take an order for a pizza, with many possible combinations of toppings. Creating subclass to superclass Pizza for each combination would create Class Explosion. So we create a Decorative Layer on top that could accommodate multiple combinations but return the same class ultimately.
This decorating layer will have **both 'has-a' & 'is-a' relationships** with the base class.

<br></br>



## 5. Facade Pattern

### Definition

- A pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. 
- It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

#### Benefits
* Reduces complexity for the client code.
* Decouples the client from the subsystem, promoting loose coupling.
* Makes it easier to use a subsystem as the client only needs to know about the facade.

### Purpose

This pattern is particularly useful 
when you want to reduce the complexity of interacting with multiple classes or libraries.

### Use cases

### Design

- `Facade` Class: This class provides a simplified interface to the complex subsystem.
- `Subsystem` Classes: These are the classes that the Facade interacts with. They contain the actual business logic.

### Example

Let's create an example for a home theater system that consists of several components: 
a DVD player, a projector, and a sound system.

### Implementation

1. Create `Subsystem Classes`

```java
class DVDPlayer {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("DVD Player is ON");
    }
    public void play(String movie) {
        System.out.println("Playing movie: " + movie);
    }
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("DVD Player stopped");
    }
    public void off() {
        System.out.println("DVD Player is OFF");
    }
}
```

```java
class Projector {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("Projector is ON");
    }
    public void setInput(String input) {
        System.out.println("Projector input set to: " + input);
    }
    public void off() {
        System.out.println("Projector is OFF");
    }
}
```

```java
class SoundSystem {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("Sound System is ON");
    }
    public void setVolume(int level) {
        System.out.println("Sound System volume set to: " + level);
    }
    public void off() {
        System.out.println("Sound System is OFF");
    }
}
```

2. Create the `Facade Class`

```java
class HomeTheaterFacade {
    private DVDPlayer dvdPlayer;
    private Projector projector;
    private SoundSystem soundSystem;

    public HomeTheaterFacade(DVDPlayer dvdPlayer, Projector projector, SoundSystem soundSystem) {
        this.dvdPlayer = dvdPlayer;
        this.projector = projector;
        this.soundSystem = soundSystem;
    }

    public void watchMovie(String movie) {
        System.out.println("Get ready to watch a movie...");
        projector.on();
        projector.setInput("DVD");
        soundSystem.on();
        soundSystem.setVolume(10);
        dvdPlayer.on();
        dvdPlayer.play(movie);
    }

    public void endMovie() {
        System.out.println("Shutting movie theater down...");
        dvdPlayer.stop();
        dvdPlayer.off();
        soundSystem.off();
        projector.off();
    }
}

```

3. `Client` code to demonstrate the usage

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
        DVDPlayer dvdPlayer = new DVDPlayer();
        Projector projector = new Projector();
        SoundSystem soundSystem = new SoundSystem();

        HomeTheaterFacade homeTheater = new HomeTheaterFacade(dvdPlayer, projector, soundSystem);

        homeTheater.watchMovie("Inception");
        homeTheater.endMovie();
}
```

<br></br>

## 6. Flyweight Pattern

### Definition

A pattern that aims to minimize memory usage by sharing common data among multiple objects.

### Purpose

- This is especially useful when dealing with a large number of similar objects. 
- Instead of creating separate instances for each object, you can reuse existing instances.

### Use cases

### Design

- `Flyweight` class: The shared object that contains the intrinsic state (common data).
- `Intrinsic State`: The part of the state that can be shared across multiple objects.
- `Extrinsic State`: The part of the state that cannot be shared and is passed to the `Flyweight` object.

### Example

Let's create a simple example of a text editor that manages different font styles.

### Implementation

1. Define the `Flyweight` Interface

```java
interface Font {
    void display(int size, String color);
}
```

2. Create `Concrete Flyweight` Classes

```java
class ConcreteFont implements Font {
    private String fontType; // Intrinsic state

    public ConcreteFont(String fontType) {
        this.fontType = fontType;
    }

    @Override
    public void display(int size, String color) {
        System.out.println("Font: " + fontType + ", Size: " + size + ", Color: " + color);
    }
}
```

3. Create a `Flyweight Factory`

```java
class FontFactory {
    private static final HashMap<String, Font> fontMap = new HashMap<>();

    public static Font getFont(String fontType) {
        Font font = fontMap.get(fontType);
        if (font == null) {
            font = new ConcreteFont(fontType);
            fontMap.put(fontType, font);
            System.out.println("Creating new font: " + fontType);
        }
        return font;
    }
}
```

4. Client code to demonstrate the usage

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Font font1 = FontFactory.getFont("Arial");
        font1.display(12, "Red");

        Font font2 = FontFactory.getFont("Arial");
        font2.display(14, "Blue");

        Font font3 = FontFactory.getFont("Times New Roman");
        font3.display(16, "Green");

        // Both font1 and font2 point to the same Arial font instance
        System.out.println("font1 == font2: " + (font1 == font2));
}
```


<br></br>


## 7. Proxy Pattern

### Definition

- A design pattern that provides an object representing another object. 
- It acts as a surrogate or placeholder to control access to that object, allowing for additional functionality, such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, or caching.

### Purpose

### Use cases

### Design

* `Subject`: An interface that defines the common interface for the RealObject and the Proxy.
* `RealObject`: The actual object that the proxy represents and delegates requests to.
* `Proxy`: The class that implements the Subject interface and contains a reference to the RealObject. It controls access to the RealObject.

### Example

Let's illustrate the Proxy Design Pattern with a simple example involving image loading.

### Implementation

1. Create the `Subject Interface`

```java
public interface Image {
    void display();
}
```

2. Implement the `RealObject`

```java
public class RealImage implements Image {
    private String filename;

    public RealImage(String filename) {
        loadImageFromDisk();
        this.filename = filename;
    }

    private void loadImageFromDisk() {
        System.out.println("Loading " + filename);
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Displaying " + filename);
    }
}
```

3. Create the `Proxy`

```java
public class ProxyImage implements Image {
    private RealImage realImage;
    private String filename;

    public ProxyImage(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        if (realImage == null) {
            realImage = new RealImage(filename);
        }
        realImage.display();
    }
}
```

4. `Client` code to demonstrate the usage

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Image image1 = new ProxyImage("image1.jpg");
        Image image2 = new ProxyImage("image2.jpg");

        // Image will be loaded from disk
        image1.display();
        System.out.println();

        // Image will not be loaded from disk, already loaded
        image1.display();
        System.out.println();

        // Image will be loaded from disk
        image2.display();
    }
```
