# Database Design

## Key Considerations for designing a database

### 1. Data Partitioning
* Consideration: Distributing data across multiple nodes or partitions.
* Importance: Ensures even distribution of data, preventing hotspots and enabling horizontal scalability.
* How: Sharding

### 2. Load Balancing
* Consideration: Distributing incoming requests or tasks evenly across multiple servers or nodes.
* Importance: Optimizes resource utilization, prevents overloading specific nodes, and ensures efficient handling of varying workloads.
* How: Sharding

### 3. Fault Tolerance
* Consideration: Building systems that can tolerate and recover from failures.
* Importance: Enhances system reliability by minimizing downtime and maintaining functionality in the face of hardware or software failures.
