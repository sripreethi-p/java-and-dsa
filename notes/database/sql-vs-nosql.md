| When to use     | When data integrity and complex transactions are crucial. For applications with structured data and relationships, such as financial systems, customer relationship management (CRM), and enterprise resource planning (ERP). When you need strong consistency and complex queries with JOIN operations. | When dealing with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. For applications requiring high performance and scalability, such as real-time web applications, big data analytics, and content management systems. When the schema is likely to evolve or when working with data that doesn’t fit neatly into tables. |
