## Searching Techniques

### 1. Linear Search
Also called sequential search algorithm, starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found.  
**Time Complexity:** O(n) worst, O(1) best  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) 

### 2. Binary Search
Used in sorted arrays, repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.  
**Time Complexity:** O(log n) worst, O(1) best  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) {recursive call stack: O(log n)}

### 3. Ternary Search
Like how binary search makes 2 parts, ternary search makes 3 parts.  
**Time Complexity:** O(log n) worst, O(1) best  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) {recursive call stack: O(log n)}
