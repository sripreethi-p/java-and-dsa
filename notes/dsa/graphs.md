# Graphs

Graph Data Structure is a collection of nodes connected by edges. Itâ€™s used to represent relationships between different entities.

## Graph Representation

### Adjacency Matrix

For a graph with with n nodes/vertices, you have an adjacency matrix of nXn.

### Adjacency List

An array of Lists is used to store edges between two vertices. The size of array is equal to the number of vertices (i.e, n). Each index in this array represents a specific vertex in the graph. The entry at the index i of the array contains a linked list containing the vertices that are adjacent to vertex i.

## Graph Traversal

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Starting from the root, all the nodes at a particular level are visited first and then the nodes of the next level are traversed till all the nodes are visited.
To do this a queue is used. All the adjacent unvisited nodes of the current level are pushed into the queue and the nodes of the current level are marked visited and popped from the queue.

## Shortest Path Algorithms

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Dijkstra's is a **single-source**, **shortest-path** algorithm. 
- It is an optimization algorithm, hence uses Greedy approach. 
- One input at a time.
- It starts at the source vertex and iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the source. 
- It then visits the neighbors of this vertex and updates their tentative distances if a shorter path is found. 
- This process continues until the destination vertex is reached, or all reachable vertices have been visited.
- Initialise the sources vertex's distance as 0, connected vertices' distances by weights & the rest by âˆž
- **Limitation: It doesn't work for negative weights.** Because the algorithm assumes that once a node is visited and its shortest path is determined, that path will not change. However, if there are negative weights, a shorter path could be found later.
- **Time Complexity:** O ( n * vertices connected to each) => O(n^2) in case of a complete graph in the worst case

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford is a **single-source**, **shortest-path** algorithm.
- It uses DP approach : find all the ways & decide the best.
- It iterates through all the edges and relaxes them for n-1 times (n = no.of vertices)
- Why are the edges relaxed for n-1 times ? Because the max no.of edges that can be involved in a path between any two vertices is n-1 unless the graph is cyclic.
- We iterate for n-1 times to pick up the least weight (incase of negative weights)
- **Limitation: It does not work for vertices involved in a -ve weighted cyclic graph**
- Time Complexity: O( e * (n-1) ) ; e = n(n-1)/2 in a complete graph so O(n^3) in the worst case.
