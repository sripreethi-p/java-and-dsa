# Linked Lists

## Definition
A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a series of nodes connected by pointers (in C or C++) or references (in Java, Python, and JavaScript). 
Each node contains data and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list.

## Uses
- Efficient insertion and deletion compared to arrays.
- Used to implement other data structures like stack, queue and deque.

## Basic Operations
1. Insertion
2. Search an element
3. Find length
4. Reverse a linked list
5. Delete an element (given a key, given a position)
6. Get Nth node (from first, from last)

## Problems
1. Print the middle of a given linked list
2. Write a function that counts the number of times a given int occurs in a Linked List
3. Check if a linked list is a Circular Linked List
